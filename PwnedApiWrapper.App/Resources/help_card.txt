Pwned Passwords Exploration Tool %VERSION
=========================================
This utility can be run in three different primary modes:
  * -i: Interactive mode. Opens up a shell-like interface around a data source 
        allowing you to grab frequencies for one password at a time.
  * -b <passwords_file>: Batch mode. Allows you to pass in a newline-delimited 
        list of passwords in a file and grab frequencies for them all.
  * -c <pwned_passwords_db_file>: Frequency-only mode. Allows you to perform 
        actions involving frequencies only (no passwords).

Interactive Mode
================
After specifying interactive mode, pass one of the following options to specify 
a data source:
  * -a: Uses the official API. Use this option with consideration please.
  * -f <pwned_passwords_db_file>: Uses a local Pwned Password file. Plain text 
        only, must not be archived.

Example: Start interactive mode against the API:
> ppexp -i -a

Example: Start interactive mode against a local copy of Pwned Passwords:
> ppexp -i -f pwned-passwords-2.0.txt

Batch Mode
==========
After specifying batch mode, pass one of the following options to specify a data
source:
  * -a: Uses the official API. Use this option with consideration please.
  * -f <pwned_passwords_db_file>: Uses a local Pwned Password file. Plain text 
      only, must not be archived.

Example: Run `passwords.txt` through the API, output in CSV format:
> ppexp -b passwords.txt -a plain

Example: Run `passwords.txt` through a local copy of Pwned Passwords, output in 
Coq format:
> ppexp -b passwords.txt -f pwned-passwords-2.0.txt coq

Formats
=======
Batch mode supports returning results in one of two formats:
  * plain: Used by default, results will be returned in CSV format.
  * coq: Results will be returned in a lookup structure compatible with the Coq
    proof assistant.

Frequency-Only Mode
===================
After specifying batch mode, pass one of the following options to specify a 
query mode:
  * -l <limit>: Gets all frequencies above a threshold.
  * -t <count>: Gets a number of the highest frequencies. Note that this assumes
    the data file is sorted by frequency.

Example: Get all frequencies above 1000000:
> ppexp -c pwned-passwords-2.0.txt -l 1000000

Example: Get top 100 frequencies:
> ppexp -c pwned-passwords-2.0.txt -t 100
